# 25to1760MHzSA
App for data acquisition from RTL2832 receiver. It works as a spectrum analyzer from 25 to 1760 MHz.

The current solution uses the savefigure method from matplotlib to generate the graphics. This solution has proven to be too slow for real time graph ploting. With this, a new type of graph plot will be desinged on the master branch.
